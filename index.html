      <h2>The Campus Friction Audit — Assignment Survey</h2>
      <p class="tease">You are an independent consultant. FLAME University has hired you to audit one specific vertical of the campus experience. Your goal is to quantify friction with data, not to complain.</p>

      <p><strong>Choose one of the domains (each student selects a different domain):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Commute: shuttle service schedule, comfort, connectivity (Aditi)</li>
        <li>The Mess Hall: quality, hygiene, variety of buffet meals (Abhipsha)</li>
        <li>The Campus Cafes: price, speed of service, variety (Diya)</li>
        <li>The Vivekananda Library: study environment, book availability, noise (Navreet)</li>
        <li>The Gym and Sports: equipment access, court maintenance, booking (Chhavi)</li>
        <li>The Health Centre: doctor availability, response speed, pharmacy (Akshita)</li>
        <li>Hostel Housekeeping: cleaning frequency, laundry turnaround, hygiene (Sanya)</li>
        <li>Information Technology Services: Wi‑Fi speed, LMS access, tech support (Pranav Shinde)</li>
        <li>The Program Office: transcripts, bonafide letters, ID cards (Dhruv Bishnoi)</li>
        <li>Career Services: internships, placement guidance, resume workshops (Aryan)</li>
        <li>Student Clubs and Events: event quality and joining ease (Pranav Vijay)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Survey instructions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Design a 10-question survey specific to your assigned domain.</li>
        <li>Include a Net Promoter Score question (e.g., how likely to recommend).</li>
        <li>Include a Customer Effort Score (e.g., how easy was it to accomplish X).</li>
        <li>Include a Behavioral Frequency question (e.g., how many times this week).</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Data handling:</strong> When you complete the survey your response is recorded on the server in <code>all_responses.json</code>. Responses are not displayed or downloadable from this landing page to protect privacy for the assignment.</p>
